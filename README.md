# Sokuri
This project started as a team effort, originally designed by lovely [@sian0811](https://github.com/sian0811). With her permission, I have taken over the development to complete the project solo. It remains WIP, but the core features and functionality are taking shape.

## Current Status

Stay tuned for more to come! (e.g., testing with Jest) 😉
